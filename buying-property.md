# Buying Property

### Borrowing & Interest Rates

* Check [https://www.hypotheekrente.nl/](https://www.hypotheekrente.nl/) to get an idea of what interest rates are available
* Check [https://www.berekenhet.nl/hypotheek/maximale-hypotheek-berekenen.html](https://www.berekenhet.nl/hypotheek/maximale-hypotheek-berekenen.html) to get an idea of not only how much you can borrow, but also compare different mortgage schemes \(linear vs annuity\)
* First time buyers may not have to pay the 3% transfer tax

### Notary & Other Fees

* Be careful with the fees and value for money from these "Expat advisers/mortgages", I personally believe that up to € 2000 is a fair price for **financial independent** **unbiased** advice, plus to have all the paperwork, contracts etc. taken care of. All you should have to do is just turn up at the notary and sign on the dotted line.
  * The financial adviser should get you the best mortgage loan based on your requirements and to be competitively in line with what you can on find on [https://www.hypotheekrente.nl/](https://www.hypotheekrente.nl/)
* **Notary** fees should be around € 700 per each deed \(mortgage and transfer\)
* Unless you are buying a house, there is no need for a construction inspection, just an evaluation \(**Taxatie**\) which should cost around € 500. You can shop around and ask various makelaars how much they charge for this evaluation service.

### Miscellaneous 

* If your property is below € 325.000 you can get even lower interest rates with **NHG** \(National Hypotheek Guarantee\). 
* When energy-saving measures are involved, the maximum mortgage is increased by an additional 6% to **106%**. The extra 6% must be spent entirely on energy-saving measures.
