# Buying Property

### Borrowing & Interest Rates

* Check [https://www.hypotheekrente.nl/](https://www.hypotheekrente.nl/) to get an idea of what interest rates are available
* Check [https://www.berekenhet.nl/hypotheek/maximale-hypotheek-berekenen.html](https://www.berekenhet.nl/hypotheek/maximale-hypotheek-berekenen.html) to get an idea of not only how much you can borrow, but also compare different mortgage schemes \(linear vs annuity\)
* First time buyers may not have to pay the 3% transfer tax

### Notary & Other Fees

* Be careful with the fees and value for money from these "Expat advisers/mortgages", I personally believe that up to € 2000 is a fair price for **financial independent** **unbiased** advice, plus to have all the paperwork, contracts etc. taken care of. All you should have to do is just turn up at the notary and sign on the dotted line.
  * The financial adviser should get you the best mortgage loan based on your requirements and to be competitively in line with what you can on find on [https://www.hypotheekrente.nl/](https://www.hypotheekrente.nl/)
* **Notary** fees should be around € 700 per each deed \(mortgage and transfer\)
* Unless you are buying a house, there is no need for a construction inspection, just an evaluation \(**Taxatie**\) which should cost around € 500. You can shop around and ask various makelaars how much they charge for this evaluation service.

### Miscellaneous 

* If your property is below € 325.000 you can get even lower interest rates with **NHG** \(National Hypotheek Guarantee\). 
* When energy-saving measures are involved, the maximum mortgage is increased by an additional 6% to **106%**. The extra 6% must be spent entirely on energy-saving measures.

### Fixed Mortgage Interest Rates

* How do you decide whether to fix mortgage interest rate for 10 or 20 years?
  * Depends on your own preferences and expectations. e.g. if your loan to value will improve within 10 years it can be advantageous to set it for 10 years and then get a better rate. However many mortgage providers will also lower the interest if your loan to value increases significantly even though you're still on the hook for several years
* Check [https://beurs.fd.nl/rente-valuta/](https://beurs.fd.nl/rente-valuta/) under **Europese kapitaalmarkt &gt; IRS** for market expectation for interest rate \(i.e. the 'yield curve'\). You can consider laddering your rates in conjunction with your mortgage advisor \(i.e. mix of fixed with different terms - split 50/50 between 10y and 20y\).
