# Moving & Removals

{% hint style="info" %}
"Since Brexit, if you are moving back to UK you need to fill in a TOR \(transfer of residence form\) listing personal belongings declaring them as tax-free."
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Check with the municipality, in most cases you do not have to pay for parking, or get in trouble if you block the street for a short period of time e.g. [https://www.denhaag.nl/en/parking/parking-permits/parking-permits-for-companies/parking-for-movers.htm  ](https://www.denhaag.nl/en/parking/parking-permits/parking-permits-for-companies/parking-for-movers.htm%20)
