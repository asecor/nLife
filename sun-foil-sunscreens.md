What suppliers have told me about 3M:

> The most commonly used solar control foil in homes is the 3M Prestige foil for mounting on the outside.
>
> This foil has a low glare and filters the sunlight in an intelligent way so that more heat is retained in the summer than in the winter.
>
> An additional advantage is that no metal particles have been processed in the foil, so that no corrosion can occur at the cut edges.
>
> 1. The foil is applied to the outside of the windows, this is very important, because this really keeps the heat outside. As a result, the chance of thermal glass breakage is virtually nil. Foils that are applied to the inside work less well and have a greater risk of thermal glass breakage.
> 2. 3M gives a unique warranty on the film and on thermal glass breakage.
> 3. You opt for top quality. The 3M Prestige 70 Exterior is almost completely transparent and blocks ± 50% of the total solar energy. The 40 Exterior is a shade darker and blocks ± 60% of the total solar energy.
> 4. You opt for convenience and comfort. We apply it professionally for you, in such a way that it is invisible.
