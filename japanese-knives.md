### Whetstone Basics

Whetstones grits are typically divided into three categories: coarse, medium, and fine. When building a set you should first purchase a medium stone in the 800-2000 range for general sharpening. Later, you can add a coarse stone \(200-600\) and a finishing stone \(3000-8000\). It is important to note that while any steel can be sharpened to any grit, not every steel will stay at that grit for very long. If a knife is already sharp, a higher grit whetstone can be used to maintain it. If a knife is very dull, a coarser stone will be better suited for resetting the edge.

#### Honing

For softer steels below 60 HRC sharpening can be supplemented with honing. You can read more [about honing here](https://www.reddit.com/r/chefknives/wiki/honing).

#### Pull through sharpeners

Pull through sharpeners should be avoided regardless of if they are handheld, electric, ceramic, or diamond.

#### Whetstone recommendations <a id="wiki_whetstone_recommendations"></a>

For beginners, by far the _two most common recommendations are \(1\) a_ [_single 1000 grit stone_](https://www.reddit.com/r/chefknives/comments/icuif5/the_comprehensive_beginners_stone_buying_guide/) _or \(2\) a combination stone like the King 1k/6k or Suehiro 1k/3k_. See [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/chefknives/comments/ej66dq/i_bought_a_knife_now_what/fcvvu5p?context=3) for some back-and-forth over what the better option is.

Here are some "tried and true" whetstones you might want to consider. See the [page on whetstones](https://www.reddit.com/r/chefknives/wiki/whetstones) for more recommendations and detailed breakdowns.
