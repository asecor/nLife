### Espresso 101 <a href="#wiki_espresso_101" id="wiki_espresso_101"></a>

_Espresso starts with the **coffee bean**. Fresher is better. As_ [_u/Beans\_McGhee_](https://www.reddit.com/u/Beans\_McGhee) _says, "The beans really need to be roasted within the month you use them for perfect espresso." Store-bought beans are fine, really—but part of the "fun" of espresso is trying different beans._

_You **grind** your coffee beans using a grinder. This sub has lots of opinions on grinders._

_The amount of ground coffee you use is called the **dose**. So when_ [_u/SingularLattice_](https://www.reddit.com/u/SingularLattice) _says, "Make sure you have the right dose for your basket", that's what he means._

_A **basket** is the little metal cup that goes in your **portafilter**—that's the metal thing with a handle on it. Espresso machines often come with 4 baskets: a single and a double in both unpressurized and pressurized. Doubles are the larger ones; pressurized variants are a different shape and may say "dual wall" on the bottom._

_You would use dual-wall if you are using pre-ground coffee. Almost everyone will make ("pull") double shots—when you get into weights and times, it's all based on a double. **So you should likely use the unpressurized (single wall) double basket.**_

_Advanced practitioners will dose by **weight**. Typically, you'd want \~7g for a single shot and \~18g for a double shot. Automatic grinders may dose by **time**: this will get you "close enough". Thus, the "single" dose will be around 7g and the "double" will be around 18g. (You can fine-tune these amounts—more on that later.)_

_Coffee grounds are light and fluffy, but you want them to be compact for espresso, so you **tamp** them (with your tamper). Advanced practitioners will calibrate their tamping pressure (e.g., with spring-loaded tampers)—don't worry about that. Just give it a reasonable amount of force. If you're putting your whole body weight on your tamper, that's too much._

_You will get a feel for the right amount of force. You can also look at the level of the grounds in the basket. Use shape of your tamper or other tool to estimate how much space should be between your (tamped) grounds and the top of the basket._

_As_ [_u/SingularLattice_](https://www.reddit.com/u/SingularLattice) _says, "You need to tamp FLAT, not hard. So long as it’s firm, you’re good."_

_At the advanced level, preparing espresso is all about **ratios**, namely weight and time. Generally, you want a 2:1 ratio in about 30 seconds. The 2:1 ratio means the ratio of your dose (i.e., \~18g) to the resulting espresso (i.e., \~36g). The process of brewing espresso is called **extraction**._

_Many espresso machines will do this for you! When you press the double shot button, it will dispense enough water to make the "right" amount of espresso... presuming you're using the right basket and the right dose! With such machines (e.g., the Breville Barista Express, or BBE), what you should do is watch the pressure gauge. It should be in the "espresso range". (Advanced practitioners will measure pressure in bars—you want \~9 bars in an ideal world.)_

_If the pressure is low, you either need more grounds (higher dose)—which you can get by adjusting the grind amount—or a finer grind—which you can get by adjusting grind size. You may also need to tamp harder, but typically this isn't the problem._

_(If your pressure is too high, the inverse is true... but this doesn't happen very often.)_

_Every bean is different, and so needs different settings to produce a good result—in your case, to keep that pressure dial where you want it. The process of adjusting these different settings is called **dialing in**._

_Your goal here is a **well-extracted shot**. That's all about how it tastes! Espresso should be sweet and balanced. If it's sour, it's **under-extracted** (to which you would grind more and/or finer); if it's bitter or astringent, it's **over-extracted** (to which you would do the opposite)._

_Everyone here is adjusting all these variables (bean, pressure, grind size, dose, ratio, extraction time, and more) in search of the perfect shot!_
